# Facebook groups post sorting & highlighting

This little [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) script sorts and highlights posts in a Facebook group by date (descending). So it makes it easier to browse the **Actual Latest Posts**, compared to the options Facebook offers *Recent Activity* and *Top Posts*.

I wrote the script to simplify my room hunt (literally) in Amsterdam in summer 2018 and now thought it would be great to share it. Have fun!
